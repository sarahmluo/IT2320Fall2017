	<h2>A Little Change Can Make a Big Difference</h2>
	
	<p>
	In 2016, the amount of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere reached 400ppm. This is
	the highest CO2 concentration in human history. What this means is that we, the human race, have 
	yet to make the changes we need to responsibly care for this little blue planet we call home.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Global temperatures have risen along with the rise in CO2 levels. This can cause some pretty disturbing side effects, as detailed 
	in this quote from <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-the-world-passed-a-carbon-threshold-400ppm-and-why-it-matters">Yale Environment 360:</a>
	</p>
	
	<blockquote cite="https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-the-world-passed-a-carbon-threshold-400ppm-and-why-it-matters">
	"At the current rate of growth in CO2, 
	levels will hit 500 ppm within 50 years, 
	putting us on track to reach temperature 
	boosts of perhaps more than 3 degrees C (5.4&deg;F) â€” 
	a level that climate scientists say would cause 
	bouts of extreme weather and sea level rise that would 
	endanger global food supplies, cause disruptive mass migrations, 
	and even destroy the Amazon rainforest through drought and fire."

	It's clear that something needs to be done, but what? Well, we can all start by making a small change 
	in the way we live. Here are some ideas:
	<ul>
		<li> Eat less meat 
			<ul>
				<li> This is probably the single most effective thing we can do. 
				According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpziz8cJMaI" target="_blank">this video</a>
				from the Humane Society, if we all went one day a week without eating meat, it would have the same 
				effect as taking half a million cars off the road!
				</li>
				<li> When you do consume meat, make sure it is sourced from organic, sustainable farms. 
				Buy only grass-fed beef. If you can, buy local from a farmer's market. 
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> Reduce Waste
			<ul>
				<li> Mend your clothes and shoes instead of buying new ones. </li>
				<li> Save glass jars from the grocery store to use as containers for other items. </li>
				<li> Limit your use of plastic wrap and baggies buy using re-usable containers. Sometimes 
				you don't even need the wrap anyway! </li>
				<li> When eating out, bring your own take-out container. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> Reduce use of Fossil Fuels
			<ul>
				<li> Buy locally grown produce and locally made products - this reduces the demand for items shipped from 
				far away using gasoline and other fossil fuels. It has the added bonus of boosting the local economy too!
				</li>
				<li> Turn off lights that are not being used.
					<ul>
						<li> Switching to LED light bulbs helps save power too.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li> Use a programmable thermostat to optimize your furnace/AC use.
				</li>
				<li> If feasible, every once in a while, walk to the grocery store/bank/post office instead 
				of driving. It's great exercise, so you'll feel better too!
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p> These are just a few ideas of ways we can help change the world for the better. If we all do our part, 
	these little changes will make a big difference!
